    <h1>Reddit Usability Heuristics</h1>

    <p>Using Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics, I evaluated Reddit's user interface 
    to see how it stacks up.</p>

    <h2>Here are the results:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Visibility of system status - I think this is something Reddit can do better, 
            but they still employ some tactics discussed by Jakob Nielson. For example, 
            when you click the “post” button, the button changes the “post” text into a 
            swirling circle, similar to many websites that change the cursor to a swirling 
            circle when something is in progress. Since it is commonly used, it is easier 
            for the user to understand, and it gives feedback that the user’s input was read
             and is processing. Another interaction that is clearly visible is upvoting and
              downvoting. Upvotes change the arrow to be colored in orange, and downvotes 
              change the arrow to be colored in blue (there’s a screenshot of the orange 
              in another section below). <img id="Reddit Visibility" src="redditfeedback.png"
